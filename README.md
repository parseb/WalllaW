# WalllaW


A <b>Decentralized Internet Native Organization</b> framework that instrumentalizes fungibility to facilitate access to fully trustless and explainable collective efforts. It accomplishes this by means of three low-complexity devices: inflation, majority vote and membership.

<br>
If you've been around, it's a structure that can self-replicate and uses "guild.xyz"-like authorisation and coordinape-like circles to govern its identity and direct its energy. No proposals.

Decentralized Internet Organizations are anarchically constituted <b>membranes that move</b> towards a continously defined forward.<br>

## How does it work


### Membrane

The membrane determines if an agent is within or outside the organisation. It is constitued out of a list of tokens and balances and, provided an agent satisfies them as eligibility conditions, associated with a membership token. The membership token gives one access to all internal functionality of that specific entity and it can be revoked though the fault of the posessor or change in elegibility conditions. Each sub-DAO instance is intependent in its determinations of membership. As such exeternal specialized work or other DAOs can be appended. The membrane is expected to link to metadata such as social media communication channels or membership-gated workspaces.

### Movement

Movement occurs through agent-driven initiative and retroactive, contiguous allocation of resources. Resource allocation is a feedback mechanism. Whether taking the form of a separate working space (subDAO) or within an existing one, insufficient allocations for or dwindling support in favour of other, potentially more pressing efforts, is to be interpreted as feedback reflecting on the work in context. Initiating movement or calibrating energy allocations is primarily available only to members. Local power is proportional with an agent's stake.
